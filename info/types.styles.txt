There are three types of Styles we can write

1. Inline
2. Internal
3. External

1. Inline 
    Where you add the styles directly to the html tags
    
    For Example:
    <h1 style="background:red">Get the freedom you deserve.</h1>

2. Internal
    Where you add the styles in the head tag

    For Example:
    <head>
        <style>
            section {
                background-color: red;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    i. What happens here, background-color red will be applied to all sections tag 
       out there in the page

3. External
    Where you add the styles in external file and link it to the main html file
    in the head tag

    For Example:
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
    </head>

NOTE: 

    We've three types which one to use. let's go for the cons of the types
    1. Inline
        Writing inline means you have to write everywhere in each tags. 
        We'll be writing codes again and again. It's not a good thing
    2. Internal
        Writing Internal will save repeated codes. But when we need it different
        page, we've to write it all again. If we include internal styles and every html
        has to download codes. Then writing internal is also not good
    3. External
        The Final one and the best one. Repeated codes can be removed. Write it in one place
        and include it anywhere you want. Browser will also do caching. So the external is the best.
