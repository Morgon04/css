Selectors
    What do you mean by selectors, it's way identifying dom elements
    It has types and follows
        1. Elements
        2. Class
        3. Universal (Rarely Used One)
        4. IDs (Set style to one specific element)
        5. Attributes

1. Elements
    In html, elements are individual component of HTML document, for Example it has 
    
    <h1></h1> -> Container Tag -> Tag will contain something btw them -> <h1> Hello </h1>
    <br/> -> Empty Tag -> Tags will be empty

    So how to use elements for css, follow the below Example

    h1 {
        color: red
    }

2. Class
    Class is also called attributes of the elements in the html. Using class we can write css much more
    efficently rather than using elements
    
    To do that we need include class attribute in the element followed by the classname

    For Example 

    i. Elements (using cabab case name for classname is highly recommended)
        <h1 class="header-tags> Hello </h1>

    ii. css
        .header-tags {
            color: yellow;
        }

3. Universal
    The word itself has meaning, applying css to all. Usauly done with *. People Rarely use this

    For Example :-
    * {
        color: red;
    }

4. IDs
    Set Style one specific element as IDs are unique

    For Example :-
    HTML
    <h1 id="example-four"> Hello </h1>
    
    css
    #example-four {
        color: purple
    }

5. Attributes
    The final one is Attribute to set equal style to all elements with same attribute

    For Example :-
    HTML
    <button disabled> I'm Disabled </button>

    CSS
    [disbaled] {
        background: grey
    }
